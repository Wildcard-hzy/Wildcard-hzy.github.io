<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

This is Zengyi Han.

Currently, I am a lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Dalian Maritime University, China. I reveived my Ph.D. from Department of Information & Communication Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Japan in 2023 (supported by Japan MEXT). My research interest includes Mobile Computing, Ubiquitous Computing and AIoT. I have published at the top international journal and conferences such as IEEE TMC, PerCom, ICDCS.
